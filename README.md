# Discord Bot with LLM Integration

This Discord bot leverages an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) to engage in conversations.

## Features

### Future features
- Stores conversation history in a SQLite database.
- Retrieves and utilizes past conversations to make interactions contextually richer.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Discord account and a bot token.
- OpenAI API key for accessing GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Usage

Once the bot is running and invited to your Discord server, it will respond to messages sent in the text channel where it has permissions to read and write messages.

## Development

This project is in the prototype phase. Future enhancements will include more sophisticated memory management and improved decision-making capabilities.
