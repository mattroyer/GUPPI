# GUPPI: General Utility for Profound Personal Interactions

GUPPI is a Discord Bot with LLM Integration. The bot leverages an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) to engage in conversations. The name is inspired by the loveable Bobiverse series. I know it's common to use Jarvis as your assistant, but GUPPI is more fun to say.

## Features

- Real-time interaction with your user on Discord using GPT-3.5-turbo (or any locall LLM with Ollama)

### Future features
- Stores conversation history in a SQLite database.
- Retrieves and utilizes past conversations to make interactions contextually richer.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Discord account and a bot token.
- OpenAI API key for accessing GPT-3.5-turbo.
- (optional) Ollama installed

## Usage

Once the bot is running and invited to your Discord server, it will respond to messages sent in the text channel where it has permissions to read and write messages.

## Development

This project is in the prototype phase. Future enhancements will include more sophisticated memory management and improved decision-making capabilities.
